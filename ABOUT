This file is part of the client-side of CampusTrees and contains information about the project.

Dr. Tommy Parker who headed up the UWRL provided the data and ideas for the project while Michael Brown, Joel Cambon, Rachel Determann, and Jimmy Murphy developed the software code. 
Development started in Spring 2012 and then it was agreed--by the developers--to be released under the terms of the GPLv3 in 2014.

The client-side was originally called the Uofl Trees application and was originally developed for Android as
a Computer Engineering Capstone Design project in Spring 2012, for
the University of Louisville's Urban Wildlife Research Lab.
